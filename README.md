# Expense-Tracker-using-DSA-Concepts
Expense Tracker Application
Overview
The Expense Tracker is a comprehensive C++ final project for the 3rd-semester Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. This project showcases our ability to implement various DSA concepts in a real-world application, ensuring a well-structured and efficient codebase.

Project Features
User Account Management
Secure login and account creation.
Storage of user details such as salary, fixed expenses, and savings goals.
Expense Tracking
Real-time expense tracking through bank transaction messages and manual entries.
Categorization of expenses for better organization.
Utilization of linked lists and priority queues for efficient data handling.
Report Generation
Detailed financial reports summarizing total expenses, remaining budget, and savings.
Visualization of spending patterns and progress towards savings goals.
Data Persistence
Saving and loading of user and expense data for continuity across sessions.
Use of hash tables for efficient user data management.
Priority Queues
Displaying top and lowest expenses using priority queues for better financial insights.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: C++
Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures and file handling
The Expense Tracker application intricately implements various data structures and algorithms to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience. The following key components were developed:

User Management: Hash tables are used for efficient management and retrieval of user data.
Expense Management: Linked lists are utilized to manage expense entries, allowing for easy insertion and deletion operations.
Category Management: A binary search tree is implemented to manage different categories of expenses.
Top Expenses: Priority queues help in identifying and displaying the highest and lowest expenses.
Demonstration
A video featuring Visual Studio is included in the repository, providing a firsthand look at our coding process and the seamless functionality of the Expense Tracker.
